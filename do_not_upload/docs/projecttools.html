    <td width="793"><p>It is important that you understand some of the basic terms used by   Project Tools.</p>
      <p>Project – this is the general   organizational unit in Project Tools. Each project should represent a   collection of items that need to be completed to allow something to come   to fruition. A project can cover anything you wish, from developing a 
        piece of software to building a car. </p>
      <p>Issue – the basic unit of a project. An   issue is a specific item that needs to be completed. A project would   contain many issues. An issue can cover anything you want, though you   may want to define your own issue types to make the issue “fit”. </p>
      <p>Tag – a tag is a form of meta-data to   enable structured searching on data that can’t easily be represented   otherwise. You may define any tags you wish. Common uses include   creating tags for the topics the issue covers. Alternatively, tags could <br />
        represent actions that need to be taken for issues to be   completed, such as reviews being made. </p>
      <p>Issue Type – an issue type is a way of   grouping issues within a project. All issues must be assigned to an   issue type. An issue type allows use of specific phrases (“Post New   Bug”) and specific statuses (“Fixed”) for issues of that type.   Additionally, 
        permissions are definable per issue type. </p>
      <p>Issue Status – an issue status simply   describes the progress of the issue. These are specified per issue type. </p>
      <p>Petition – petitions allow users to   request that an issue’s status be changed. This is useful to draw   attention to an issue with a resolution that may not be correct. A   developer may assume a bug is fixed, but it may not fix the issue for a  user. This user 
        could submit a petition to change the status back to   “Confirmed”. </p>
    <p>These terms are discussed in more detail in the appropriate   sections. </p></td>

      <p><strong>Summary</strong> – this is a one line   description of the project. It is shown on the project list page and on   the forum list if the project is shown (see below). HTML is allowed. </p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong> – this is a long   description of the project. It will only be shown when viewing this   project’s overview page. A fairly large space is dedicated to this, so   you can write a fair amount. However, anyone that can see this project <br />
      will be able to see the description. HTML is allowed. </p>
      <p><strong>Display Order</strong> – this controls the order   in which projects are displayed. Lower numbers are displayed first. A   display order of 0 will hide the project from the list, though it will   still appear in the forum list (if desired) and be directly accessible <br />
      if the URL is known. </p>
      <p><strong>Required Fields</strong> – the fields shown here   are usually optional, but you may choose to make one or more of them   required. This will prevent users from submitting issues with Unknown   selected for these fields. A title and issue description must always <br />
      be submitted </p>
      <p><strong>Display After Forums</strong> – this setting   allows you to show project information in the main forum list. See below   for more information on this setting </p>
      <p>T<strong>itle in Forum List</strong> – if you choose to   use the Display After Forums option, this option allows you to override   the project title and show something else in the forum list. This is   helpful as the project title may not be descriptive enough without the <br />
      context of other projects around it. If you leave this blank,   the default title will be used, but preceded by the word Project. </p>
      <p><strong>Base Permissions off of Existing Project</strong> – this option allows you to copy the custom permissions from an   existing project to this one. It is only presented if you are creating a   new project. If you do not choose to use this option, you will need to <br />
      create the permissions manually later. </p>
      <p><strong>Available Issue Types</strong> – you may choose   which issue types are applicable to this project. A drop down for each   issue type is shown, listing all issue statuses for that type. To use an   issue type with this project, simply select one of those statuses. <br />
      This status will be used as the default issue status; issues   created by users that don’t have permission to change the status will   always start in this status. </p>
